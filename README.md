### IMPORTANT!
The app doesn't function as required because I started learning TypeScript 7 days ago,
I learned very much and very few in the last couple of days.
I faced problems when I tried to connect the whole app to the Context API.

I was googling for fixes, but with no luck.
I would really like to learn this stuff, it seems like fun!

App doesn't function properly because I didn't configured global state management,
without that, I couldn't respect last 2 parts of assignment.

### Application Requirements

To run this project you'll need some basic files and softwares.
First you will need Git to clone this repository to your machine.

(WINDOWS Users):
Open Command Prompt or Windows Terminal or even Windows Powershell and run this
commands to clone your repository:

### `git clone https://github.com/chospredev/tvshow-movies-manager.git`

Afterwards you will need Node Package Manager to install node_modules.
Install Node latest version on your machine.
(You can check your Node version by typing "node -v" in your terminal without quotations)
Then, Node should install package manager to help you handle the installation of required files.
(You can check your Node Package Manager version by typing "npm -v" in your terminal without quotations, as well)

After checking all out, run npm install in your /tvshow-movies-manager directory.
Just like this:
### `npm install`

After npm finished installing required files, run the application with the command below.
### `npm start`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
